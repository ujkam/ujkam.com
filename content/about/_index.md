Hi, I'm Ujval.  I've worked as a Data Scientist for over a decade now.  While it wasn't intentional, a large portion of that decade was focused on use cases involving Industrial Equipment.  This included Oil & Gas Extraction and Processing, Commercial Medical Equipment, and Automotive, Pharmaceutical, and Electrical Equipment Manufacturing.  Eight years of those years were in the consulting arm of software companies, so I was able to see what different companies were trying to do with data and machine learning.  In all my jobs I worked with many different stakeholders and experienced both the business and technical side of things and got better at trying to understand why (e.g. the cost savings) people wanted to do things, and not just the technical how.  

This blog is really a manifestation of things I kept seeing across industries.  Stuff that bothered me, stuff that got stuck in a mental loop, things I wished I knew years ago, etc.  Hopefully writing these things down will help me mentally clarify my thoughts and remove these loops from my mind.  And I hope they will be informative and provide clarity to somebody else.

There's no shortage of amazing content in data science writing great technical content, and I don't feel like I have much to add there.  Most of the posts on this blog will be probably be focused on exploring the business side of trying to do data science with Industrial Machines.  In other words, instead of talking about the latest algorithm or library, I'll probably focus on the people side of things and the financial realities we need to account for when trying to justify a data science project.
