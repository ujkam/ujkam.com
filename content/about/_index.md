Hi, I'm Ujval. I've worked as a Data Scientist for over a decade now.  For eight of those years I worked in customer facing roles, so I was able to see what different companies were trying to do with data and machine learning. As far as industries, Iâ€™ve worked on use cases in Oil & Gas Extraction and Processing, Medical Equipment, Automotive, Pharmaceutical, and Consumer Packaged Goods. In all my jobs I worked with many different stakeholders and experienced both the business and technical side of things, which made me better at understanding why people wanted to do things, and not just the technical how. 

While it wasn't intentional, a large portion of my work was focused on Industrial Equipment and Machines.  Consequently, my first blog posts will be about machines, machine data, and the business of being a Data Scientist who is expected to build things which deliver an actual financial benefit to those industries.  The goal is to provide others working on similar projects with enough context to ask better questions and make better decisions, so the things they build will actually be used, and not just end up in a long forgotten file repository.

My posts tend to be long-form.  Part of why I write this way is the squishy nature of the topics I write about, and also because I don't want to make assumptions about what readers already know. So In all my posts I try to explain the concepts and terms used.

I hope my writings will be informative and provide clarity to somebody else, especially people who are just starting out.

With the arrival of LLMs, I feel like I have to add this - the writing on this site is 100% me and 0% LLMs. Writing is one of the few activities I have where I can get into a flow state, because I can just write without interruption, even if what I'm writing is a disorganized mess.  There are other things I enjoy doing, but it's hard to not get interrupted. For example, I enjoy coding, but it's full of interruptions - looking up things, debugging an error, and trying to refactor so things stay in a logical order.  I write here because I enjoy it, not because I have to, so there's no value in me using an LLM to write any part of this blog.
