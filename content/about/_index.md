Hi, I'm Ujval. I've worked as a Data Scientist for over a decade now. Eight years of those years were in the consulting arm of software companies, so I was able to see what different companies were trying to do with data and machine learning. As far as industries, Iâ€™ve worked on use cases in Oil & Gas Extraction and Processing, Medical Equipment, Automotive, Pharmaceutical, and Consumer Packaged Goods. In all my jobs I worked with many different stakeholders and experienced both the business and technical side of things, which made me better at understanding why people wanted to do things, and not just the technical how. 

While it wasn't intentional, a large portion of that decade was focused on use cases involving Industrial Equipment and Machines. Consequently, my first blog posts will relate to predictive maintenance. They are a manifestation of things I kept seeing across industries. Stuff that bothered me, stuff that got stuck in a mental loop in my head, projects where I struggled because I didn't have enough context to ask the right questions, and things I wished I knew years ago.

My posts tend to be long-form.  Part of why is the squishy nature of the topics I write about, and also because I don't want to make assumptions about what readers already know. So In all my posts I try to explain the concepts and terms used.

I hope my writings will be informative and provide clarity to somebody else, especially people who are just starting out.
